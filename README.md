# programming-jokes-backend

This repository contains the backend code for a web application that displays programming-related jokes.

## Approach
Set up the backend using Node.js and Express. Including the parameters type and amount to be able to chose this from the frontend.
I have created an API endpoint that can fetch jokes from the endpoint (https://v2.jokeapi.dev/joke/Programming,Pun?safe-mode).

## To run this locally
To install and start the server.

#### npm install
#### npm run dev (starts nodemon) or npm start
